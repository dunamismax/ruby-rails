#### API Security
- Content-Type validation
- Request size limits
- Input sanitization
- Error handling that doesn't leak information

### Security Testing

We regularly perform:
- Static code analysis with Brakeman
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security-focused code reviews
- Penetration testing (for production deployments)

### Secure Development Practices

- All code changes go through peer review
- Security-focused test cases are included
- Dependencies are kept up to date
- Security patches are applied promptly

## Security Headers

The following security headers are configured:

- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking

- Outdated dependencies are flagged

## Configuration Security

- Secrets are stored in environment variables
- Configuration files don't contain sensitive data
- Database credentials are properly secured
- API keys are generated securely

## Infrastructure Security

For production deployments:
- Use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use secure database configurations
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Implement backup and disaster recovery

## Compliance

This project follows:
- OWASP Top 10 security practices
- Ruby on Rails security guidelines
- Industry standard security practices

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
